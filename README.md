# Roderick Hsiao

Welcome to my personal website - a digital space where technology meets creativity, and where I share my journey as an open web advocate, developer, and curious human.

## What You'll Find Here

**About Me**  
Iâ€™m a passionate technologist with a love for building meaningful experiences on the web. When I'm not coding, you'll find me dancing, spending time with animals, or exploring new coffee shops around the Bay Area.

**My Work**  
This site showcases my professional experience, speaking engagements, and contributions to the open web ecosystem. I believe in technology that empowers people and creates inclusive digital spaces.

**Travel & Experiences**  
Follow along with my adventures around the world, complete with interactive maps and stories from the places Iâ€™ve been.

**Speaking & Community**  
I regularly speak at conferences and meetups about web technologies, developer experience, and building inclusive tech communities.

## Philosophy

Iâ€™m an advocate for the open web - believing that technology should be accessible, privacy-respecting, and human-centered. This site reflects those values: itâ€™s fast, accessible, and built with care.

## Connect

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate, have me speak at your event, or just want to chat about technology, travel, or the perfect cup of coffee.
